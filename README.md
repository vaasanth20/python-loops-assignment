# Question: Weekly Temperature Analysis
Write a Python program to analyze temperature data for one week.

## Task 1: Find Maximum and Minimum
Write code to find the highest and lowest temperature from the list.

>**Input:**
>
>temperatures = [28, 32, 35, 29, 31, 27, 30]
>
>**Expected Output:**
>
>Highest Temperature: 35°C
>Lowest Temperature: 27°C

Requirements:

Use a for loop to check each temperature
Do NOT use built-in functions like max() or min()


## Task 2: Count Hot Days
Count how many days had temperature above 30°C. Skip days with temperature ≤30°C using continue.

>**Input:**
>
>temperatures = [28, 32, 35, 29, 31, 27, 30]
>
>**Expected Output:**
>
>Hot Days (>30°C): 3

** Requirements:**

Use a for loop
Use continue to skip days that are not hot (≤30°C)

## Task 3: Alert System
Count hot days but stop immediately if temperature reaches 40°C or higher using break.

>**Input:**
>
>temperatures = [28, 32, 35, 40, 31, 33, 30]
>
>**Expected Output:**
>
>Hot Days before alert: 2
>Alert! Extreme temperature 40°C detected on Day 4


**Requirements:**

- Use a for loop with day counter
- Use break when temperature ≥ 40°C
- Count only hot days (>30°C) before the alert
